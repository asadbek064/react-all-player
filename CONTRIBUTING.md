## `dist` files

There is **no need** to build or commit files in `dist` after making changes. The `dist` files will be automatically built and committed when new versions are released, so your changes will be included then.

## Linting

This project uses [standard](https://github.com/feross/standard) code style. Be sure to lint the code after making changes and fix any issues that come up.

```bash
pnpm run lint # or yarn lint
```
